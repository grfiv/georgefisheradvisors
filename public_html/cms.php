		Implemented systems and processes to manage the escalating cost of technology which had been distributed to the business units and in aggregate was growing faster than the rate of growth of revenues. A combination of better reporting and management awareness led to consolidation and senior-level oversight which resulted in a flattening in the rate of increase and more effective deployment of technology firm-wide.

		During the late 1980s, Asia became the most important profit center in the firm. I had been involved in setting up the operations in Asia in the early 1980s and was transferred overseas to manage the growth in volume, complexity and risk. I was based in Tokyo with responsibility for operations from Korea to Australia.
	</p>
	<p class="content-cv-qual">
		The business was growing rapidly: staff had to be hired, office space fitted out with technology, systems developed from scratch; credit issues arose with every new customer and every large transaction, and the Japanese Ministry of Finance launched its first full-scale audit of a foreign firm. All of these challenges and others were successfully met: the firm grew and prospered and made peace with the regulators; new products were implemented, volumes soared and we effectively found our way through the credit maze. All the while maintaining the lowest unit costs of any region.
