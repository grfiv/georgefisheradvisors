<H1>Terms and Conditions Regulating Email Collection</H1>
<H2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</H2>
<P>The website from which you accessed this agreement ("the Website") is 
provided to you subject to the following conditions. These terms are in addition 
to any other terms governing access to the Website. By visiting (in any manner) 
the Website you accept these terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service"). 
Please read them carefully.</P>
<P>Any Non-Human Visitors to the Website shall be considered agents of the 
individual(s) who controls, authors or otherwise makes use of them. These 
individuals shall ultimately be responsible for the behavior of their Non-Human 
Visitor agents and are liable for violations of the Terms of Service.</P>
<H2>SPECIAL LICENSE RESTRICTIONS FOR NON-HUMAN VISITORS</H2>
<P>Special restrictions on a visitor's license to access the Website apply to 
Non-Human Visitors. Non-Human Visitors include, but are not limited to, web 
spiders, bots, indexers, robots, crawlers, harvesters, or any other computer 
programs designed to access, read, compile or gather content from the Website 
automatically. Non-Human Visitors are restricted from taxing the resources of 
the Website beyond what would be typical of a human visitor.</P>
<P>Furthermore, as specified by the "no-email-collection" flag in the header 
pages within the Website and/or the contents of the robots.txt file, email 
addresses on this site are considered proprietary intellectual property of the 
author of the Website. It is recognized that these email addresses are provided 
for human visitors alone, and have value in part because they are accessible 
only to said human visitors. You agree 
that the compilation, storage, and potential distribution of these addresses by 
Non-Human Visitors is a violation of personal privacy. 
Intentional collection, harvesting, gathering, or storing email addresses by 
Non-Human Visitors is recognized under this agreement as a violation of this 
agreement and expressly prohibited.</P>
<H2>APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</H2>
<P>Each party agrees that any suit, action or proceeding brought by such party 
against the other in connection with or arising from the Terms of Service 
("Judicial Action") shall be governed by the law of the state of residence of 
the registered Administrative Contact (the "Admin State") for the Website as 
such laws are applied to agreements between Admin State residents entered into 
and performed entirely within the Admin State. The visitor to the Website 
consents to the jurisdiction of federal and state courts within the Admin State. 
The visitor to the Website consents to the venue in any action brought against 
him in connection with breaches of these Terms of Service. The visitor to the 
Website consents to electronic service of process regarding actions under the 
above agreement.</P>
<H2>NON-TRANSFERABILITY</H2>
<P>The access rights granted to you under the Terms of Service are 
non-transferable without the express written permission of the owner of the 
Website.</P>
<H2>RECORDS OF VISITOR USE AND ABUSE</H2>
<P>As a visitor to the Website, you consent to having your Internet Protocol 
address recorded. An email address may appear immediately below (the 
"Identifier") if we suspect potential abuse. The Identifier is uniquely matched 
to your Internet Protocol address. Visitors agree not to use this address for 
any reason.</P>
<P>VISITORS AGREE THAT HARVESTING, GATHERING, STORING, TRANSFERRING TO A THIRD 
PARTY OR SENDING ANY MESSAGE (S) TO THE IDENTIFIER CONSTITUTES AN ACCEPTANCE AND 
SUBSEQUENT BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.</P>
