    <h2>
      King Lear Act I, Scene IV
    </h2>
    <p style="text-indent: -3em; padding-left: 3em;">

      Fool: "Mark it, 'nuncle;
      <br /><br />
       Have more than thou showest,<br /> 
       Speak less than thou knowest,<br /> 
       Lend less than thou owest,<br /> 
       Ride more than thou goest,<br /> 
       Learn more than thou trowest,<br />
       Set less than thou throwest;<br />
       Leave thy drink and thy whore, and keep in-a-door,<br />
       And thou shalt have more than two tens to a score."

    </p>

    <ul><li style="list-style: none;"><ul>
      <li><b>showest</b>:  don't show all your cards, don't reveal all your worth.</li>
      <li><b>owest</b>:    don't lend someone everything you have (as the king has done).</li>
      <li><b>goest</b>:    ride more than you walk</li>
      <li><b>trowest</b>:  believe; listen to others' opinions not just those who agree with you.</li>
      <li><b>throwest</b>: stake less at dice than you throw for, play only when the odds are in your favor</li>
      <li><b>two tens to a score</b>: you'll do better than break even (two tens = twenty, a score)</li>
    </ul></li></ul>
